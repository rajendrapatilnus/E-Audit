# E-Audit
Event auditing for APT detection
The main file is APTDetectionFromAuditLogs.java. It takes a raw audit log file and with four different functions it generates the attack kill chain. Each function is implemented in a separate Java class and details (input, process, and output) of each are given below. Regarding dataset, the raw audit log files (text files), events in temporal order (csv files), threat-likely events (csv files), and attack-relevant events (csv files) are available for each attack.
